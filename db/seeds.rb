As a result, this is a great place for growing wine grapes, apples, pumpkins, and families. One of our favorite activities outside is wine tasting, but our kids are still of an impre...ssionable age and aren\'t old enough to serve as designated drivers or drinkers. So, when we want to enjoy the local wineries we need to be selective. Bonair Winery (http://www.bonairwine.com/) is on the Rattlesnake Wine Trail outside of Zillah, WA. They are a family friendly winery where kids can feed the ducks, pet the dog or play with the small collection of toys that Bonair has always kept in the corner of their tasting room. If you are on this side of Union Gap, then visit this winery. They have great reds, legendary Chardonnay, and the friendliest atmosphere in the region. If you have to go to a second winery, and the kids haven\'t started whining too much themselves, then catch Wineglass Cellars (http://www.wineglasscellars.com/) just up the road from Bonair. Dave, in the tasting room of Wineglass can fill you with great wine and fill you in on the local bicycling scene. After wine tasting, head to Granger, WA just down I-82 from Zillah and catch dinosaur park. Each year since 1996 the city shop has built a new dinosaur statue in somewhere in town. For a small town like Granger, there is almost more pre-historic lizards than people. If you are on the north end of the Yakima Valley, then head to Cowiche Canyon Conservancy\'s trails off of Scenic Drive, or Cowiche Canyon Road. These trailheads take you on walks, runs or mt bike rides through preserved shrub steppe, east slope steelhead streams, and eventually to a great wine tasting room on the Andesite bluffs overlooking the Yakima and Naches Valleys. If you are visisting in the fall, take the kids to Naches\' Thompson Farm for pumpkin picking, pumpkin doughnuts, and pumkin cannon demonstrations. They usually have a lame corn maze too that the under 10 age group loves.')

My perfect day would begin at Galbraith Mountain. The mountain has an elaborate system of trails, for all abilities and the views from the Ridge trail, Wonderland trail, and Woopsie Woodle are amazing on a clear day. On a snowy or rainy day the dark forest with huge trees covered in mos...s and lichen along the Lost Giants trail makes me feel happy and rejuvenated. I often run these trails, but they are excellent for hiking, and well known to mountain bikers. Maps are available at local running and bike stores, and you\'ll definitely want one along. If you go in the morning, you will often be alone, or see only a few folks.
After returning from a morning run (or hike), I would go the Little Cheerful Cafe on the corner of Holly and Railroad. Their breakfast hash browns and eggs benedict with endless cups of coffee will definitely fill you up, and you\'ll very likely need a nap in the sun afterwards.
Just a short walk down Holly Street, at the bottom of the hill is Maritime Heritage Park. The park has a fish hatchery, salmon ladder and a huge waterfall. It\'s an amazing place to take visitors who have never seen salmon spawning, because you can see the whole process. The ocean (saltwater) comes almost to the base of waterfall, and you can watch as the fish jump up the ladder to try to get upstream. The hatchery has interpretive signs explaining the finer details of the process. There\'s also a nice amphitheater with warm concrete benches and a view of the bay to snooze off your big breakfast.
Just a block down the street is the best maritime junk store on the planet, the Marine Exchange. I can spend hours here, but even the least boat-savvy person will enjoy a few minutes looking at all the second-hand boat equipment and maritime art here. On the floor, just inside the entry is the pile of the newest consignment items, ready to be pawed through, and often the prices haven\'t been set so you can score a great deal. Don\'t miss the basement, which is stacked floor to ceiling with even more stuff.
Towards dinner time, it would be worth a trip to Blue Fin Sushi on Samish Way. They have a selection of maki rolls on their menu that will amaze anyone. They also have a number of seasonal fish selections, and when sockeye is on the list you need to order it. Its bright red and super tasty and is best enjoyed as sushi and not complicated with other flavors in a maki roll.
Leave a little room for a stop at Mallard Ice Cream on Railroad Ave on your way home. You\'ll want to try a fudge-dipped cone: they pour a scoop of hot fudge in a waffle cone and put the ice cream over the top of it. It has the flavor of a sundae in the cone. It\'ll give you the calories you need to do it all again tomorrow.')

From there, bike on to Fairhaven, where you can get lunch at the Colophon Cafe (especially their peanut soup), check out some good reading from the independent Village Books-- for kids and adults-- and then walk around. But then, no point in resting, you can either  a) continue on the bike path out towards Chuckanut Bay, and take the old railway trail down to Larrabee State Park. You can even stop at Taylor\'s Shellfish and get fresh oysters to eat on the rocks overlooking the bay and the islands; or  b) head back downtown, and get a beer at Boundary Bay, while your kids enjoy a warm pretzel.

After breakfast, pack a lunch (a sandwich from Avenue Bread is a good option), hop in the car and head East up the Mount Baker highway.  Drive to the bitter end, and park at Artist Point.  On a late summer day there is no more glorious hike than heading out towards Mount Baker along the Ptarmigan ridge trail.  It\'s great even for young kids (we\'ve done it since the kids were 3 or 4) since most of the hike is flat.  In late summer the huckleberries are out, so it\'s nice to take a rest and nosh on some fresh berries at the side of the trail.  Hike at least to the fork that goes to Chain Lakes and eat lunch with a spectacular view of Mount Baker.    It is required, upon returning west along highway 542, to stop at the Beer Shrine (the Nooksack Brewery) for pizza and beer.  It\'s the perfect place to rest weary feet and enjoy an IPA.  And once you\'ve finished your beer and driven back to town, you\'ve probably also earned a scoop of ice cream at Mallards.  Where else can you get chocolate habanero ice cream?  Or lavender?

Pictures and story can be found at: http://bestscenicroutes.com/grand-coulee-to-wauconda-to-twisp-washington/  The hotel room is cozy, but the road beckons. Today promised to be a very memorable ride.  I head south from Grand Coulee on SR 174. The landscape rolls gradually. It is scenic, but I was hoping for more excitement to pull me from the no-coffee fog I was in. The sun rises quickly in the eastern skies as I point the bike directly into it on Jurgensen Road. Luckily, I\'m only heading east for two miles until I head north on SR 21.  Highway 21 switchback. One of many.SR 21 is exactly the excitement that I needed. The short 12-mile ride take you from the rolling fields to steep cliffs that ocerlook the Columbia River. I didn\'t count switchbacks, but they are plentiful as the road carries me down to the Keller Ferry. This stretch of Highway 21 will make motorcycle riders of all types very happy.  The Keller Ferry is a 12-vehicle vessel that crosses the 1.5 miles across the Columbia River, which is known as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake in this area. The river isn\'t naturally this wide in this area. The Grand Coulee Dam is just 15 miles down stream from here and creates the easy-going pool of water known as Franlin D. Roosevelt Lake. This is the only way to connect Hwy 21. Luckily, the ferry is free.  With blue skies overhead I watch the Keller Ferry, also known as the Martha S., approach the southern shores. The basalt cliffs across the river are so big and beautiful that they don\'t appear real. It is this kind of view that my meager photography skills can\'t do justice.  Silver Creek Road winds up, up and away. The ferry is light with my Suzuki V-Strom being the only vehicle onboard. We make the short crossing and I climb up from the river on Hwy 21. About 10 miles from the ferry dock, I turn east onto Silver Creek road. This is a gem of a road. Some riders may shy away from the dirt surface of the road. It undulates and wraps around and over itself. The road is loose and requires a slower speed for the hairpin turns. That is completely fine with me. The slower speeds allow more time to enjoy the incredible scenery that fills the valley below. This is yet another scenic route that Washington state hies beyond the reaches of pavement. Everyone looking to make time and simply get from point A to point B misses the splendor hidden in Eastern Washington.  After a few stops, the motorcycle finds pavement and begins to burn it up. The surface heaves and swallows from its age. The V-Strom\'s suspension soaks it up as I lean from peg to peg in a dance high above the Columbia River.  The road descends to the Gifford-Inchellium Ferry that carries vehicles across the upper Columbia River from Inchelium to Hwy 25 and the town of Gifford, Washington. This one is slightly larger than the first ferry. It carries several cars. The ferry jostles out from the dock. The moving water pushes the boat sideways almost as fast as the captain can power across the wide river. A skilled captain he was, as I sat on the bike and it hardly moved as he docked on the east side of the river.  From here it is just 25 miles up Hwy 25 to Kettle Falls. Kettle Falls has gas, food, coffee and most amenities that a rider may need. I fill the gas tank on my motorcycle, buy a cup of coffee and eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before continuing out of town. US 395 takes me the short distance north to FR 61 or Boulder Creek Road.  The ride along Boulder Creek Road slices through the northern tip of the Colville National Forest. The scenery is again spectacular. There are ample dirt roads that branch off of the paved Boulder Creek Road for additional exploring. This area certainly whetted my appetite. I\'ll have to journey back to explore Little Boulder Creek Road and other Forest Service roads around the Deer Creek Snopark and Green Mountain areas.  I continue my westward journey to the small community of Curlew, Washington. It appears that this is a former railroad stop town, but now lives on the few farmers, loggers and miners that remain in the area.  There isn\'t much to explore in Curlew, so I leave town on West Kettle River Road following the snake-like pattern of the Kettle River. The river provides ample drink for plant life. The river, trees hugging the shore and mountains combine for an easy place to enjoy being alone on a motorcycle. Some roads are easy to daydream and drift off on. This is yet another road on this ride that demands attention to the quickly changing details.  Along a short straight-away is a historical interpretive sign. It talks about Ronald McDonald. No, not the clown of restaurant fame. This is the Ronald McDonald who happens to have been the first person to teach the English language in Japan. This Pacific Northwestern-born man grew up near Oregon and apparently met some shipwrecked Japanese sailors as a young lad, which sparked an interest in their homeland. Eventually, he travelled there teaching actual samurai the English language. The sign says that his final resting place is just north a mile or two. I head in that direction but soon after crossing a river the road comes to a T intersection. A few teenagers swimming at the river didn\'t know which direction the burial site was in. I get back onto the main road and chase the sun instead as time didn\'t allow for too much added exploration if I was going to make my destination before dark set in.   Black and white treatment seems fitting for the ghost town of Bodie, Washington.West Kettle River Road connects with Toroda Creek Road which makes a large curve and begins heading south. Just as the sun begins to warm the right side of my body, I notice several old weather worn buildings just off both sides of the road. The Okanogan County historical society is nice enough to place information boards to keep the curious traveler informed of the areas rich history.  The old buildings are the remnants of Bodie, Washington. It is a ghost town now, but it was once the nearest town to the gold mine of the same name that was established in 1896 and helped spur the Okanogan County gold rush. In 1902, the Bodie Mine was purchased by the Wrigley family. You know, the same Wrigley\'s of chewing gum fame. They actually started what became the Bodie Mining Company in 1903. At the time, the mine was worth $1.5 million. Here we are, more than a century later and all that is left are several run down buildings that make for incredible photo opportunities right next to an incredibly fun motorcycle road.   The Ghost Town of Bodie, WA is easily viewed and explored from the road.From Bodie, the road passes through Old Toroda before connecting with SR 20 in Wauconda. My wheels push up and over the great North Cascades Highway and don\'t stop turning until I reach home on the wet side of the mountains.  This trip included viewing the largest concrete structure in the United States, climbing dirt switchback mountain roads, two small ferries and finding a ghost town and mine once owned by a famous gum manufacturer. How\'s that for a weekend well spent on two wheels? ')

Park at Fairhaven and browse Fairhaven bookstore for favorite childhood memories of books.  This is a great discussion area for a first date.  The trail from Fairhaven to Boulevard park is a nice walking distance on well traveled trail.  Once at Fairhaven frisbee is a favorite pastime at the park along with a hot cocoa at Woods Coffee outside looking over the water.    Then a stroll back to Fairhaven and if the date has gone well sharing ice cream at The Caphlon Restaurant is a must do.  This makes for a great day or date of a variety of activities.')

Sleep in then go for a quick but strenous hike up to Fragrance Lake right off of Chuckanut. Head back into town and grab a late lunch at La Fiama. Delicous pizza that you earned. Follow that with a latte from Avelino and relax down at Boulevard for the afternoon.  Go get cleaned up and head to the Up Front theater for a great, inexpensive, live comedy show. End the night with some guilty pleasure from Pure Bliss, best bakery in town. Besides you deserved it after the hike, right.')

Today it is 42 and rain. I would get up at 6am, have a jump start cup and out the door we go to Baker. If lots of new snow is on the ground ( today has 12 ) I would leave the nordic gear and dog home and have board and skis ready. by 6:30 we are on the road, stop in glacier or maple falls for another great cup and maybe some grub but I hope my cooler is full. I will leave out the details of face shots and steep terrain. ( see pic and mt baker home page) If I get back in time I could spin a lap on galbbrith and hit unemployment line. I would  top the day off with kuru kuru for sushi or scotty browns for a fish bowl. Baker is a commitment so tuned for another day.')
